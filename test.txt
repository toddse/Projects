The PrintWriter class allows you to write data to a file using the print
and println methods, as you have been using to display data on the
screen. 
Just as with the System.out object, the println method of the PrintWriter
class will place a newline character after the written data.

The print method writes data without writing the newline character.
You use the File class and the Scanner class to read data from a file.

Once an instance of Scanner is created, data can be read using the same
methods that you have used to read keyboard input (nextLine, nextInt,
nextDouble, etc).

The Scanner class’s hasNext() method will return true if another item
can be read from the file.

File class’s exists() method determine whether the file exists.
